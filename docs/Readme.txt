Downscaled European Climate Data 
.0083x.0083 degrees daily:


There are 3 ways to retrieve this data.



1) Download Everything.  
Within the AllDataRasters folder there individual folders for Tmin, Tmax, and Prcp.  
Within those folders for the raster datasets for each year.  Each year has 365 bands.  
Each band is a day starting on Jan 1.  Each map is large (~17 GB) and will take time to download.



2) Download tiled data.  
If you want to only focus on a particular area in Europe than this is a good option and found in the folder 
TiledClimateData.  Within this folder you will find the image that lays out the tiles alond with folders with 
letters for names.  These letters correspond to the x-axis of the tiles and within each of these folders are 
folder with numbers for names which correspond to the y-axis of the tiles.  
In each number folder will be all of the climate data for that tile.  Again every map has 365 bands.



3)Download the yearly averages.  
This data is just the sum of the bands divided by 365.



In all cases Temperatures are given as celsius * 100 and precipitation is given as mm * 100.
