Seasonal climate data (3 month periods) using downscaled daily E-OBS data:

Climate input: E-OBS data downscaled with World-Clim data. Downscaled climate data (Maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation) published in Moreno, A., & Hasenauer, H. (2015). Spatial downscaling of European climate data. International Journal of Climatology.DOI: 10.1002/joc.4436

Spatial resolution: 0.0083 x 0.0083 degrees

Spatial reference: WGS 1984

Temporal resolution: 4 seasons (Winter: December, January, February; Spring: March - May; Summer: June, July, August; Fall: September, October, November), 1951 to 2012

Analysis: average climate (daily mean for 3 month period)

Data structure: Each climate variable and each year has one file. 4 bands for each year, order of seasons is winter, spring, summer and fall. Thus the winter results of each year represent the december of the previous year.

Unit: degree Celsius for maximum and minimum temperatures and millimeter per day for precipitation

NoData value: -9999
