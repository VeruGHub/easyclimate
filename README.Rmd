Get high-resolution (1 km) daily climate data (precipitation, minimum and maximum temperatures) for Europe from the European climatic database hosted at [University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Vienna, Austria](https://boku.ac.at/en/wabo/waldbau/wir-ueber-uns/daten). Data are currently available from 1950 to 2020. 

This climatic dataset was originally built by [A. Moreno & H. Hasenauer](https://doi.org/10.1002/joc.4436) and further developed by W. Rammer, C. Pucher & M. Neumann (see [this document](https://github.com/VeruGHub/easyclimate/tree/master/inst/Description_Evaluation_Validation_Downscaled_Climate_Data_v2.pdf) for more details on the development and characteristics of the climatic dataset).

In this R package we implemented [Cloud-Optimised Geotiffs](https://www.cogeo.org/) so that we can obtain daily climate data for thousands of sites/days within minutes, without having to download huge rasters. But if you need to obtain data for large areas, please download the rasters from the FTP server (ftp://palantir.boku.ac.at/Public/ClimateData/) and extract the values locally rather than using this package, so as not to saturate the file server. For that, you may use a FTP client such as [FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/).


## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("VeruGHub/easyclimate")
```


## Examples

To obtain a data frame of daily climatic values for point coordinates:

```{r example, message = FALSE}
library(easyclimate)

coords <- matrix(c(-5.36, 37.40), ncol = 2)

prec <- get_daily_climate(coords, 
                          period = "2001-01-01:2001-01-03", 
                          climatic_var = "Prcp")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(prec)
```

<br>

To obtain a (multi-layer) raster of daily climatic values for an area:

```{r message=FALSE}
library(terra)

coords_poly <- vect("POLYGON ((-4.5 41, -4.5 40.5, -5 40.5, -5 41))")

ras_tmax <- get_daily_climate(
  coords_poly,
  period = c("2012-01-01", "2012-08-01"),
  climatic_var = "Tmax",
  output = "raster" # return raster
  )

par(mfrow = c(1, 2))
terra::plot(ras_tmax, 1, col = rev(heat.colors(20)), type = "continuous", smooth = TRUE, range = c(10, 35), legend = FALSE, mar=c(4, 2, 4, 2), main = "January 1 2012")
terra::plot(ras_tmax, 2, col = rev(heat.colors(20)), type = "continuous", smooth = TRUE, range = c(10, 35), mar = c(4, 1, 4, 3), main = "August 1 2012")

```
